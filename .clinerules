# Claude Code Rules for Jalali Dispatch Board

## Always Read First

- src/lib/jalali.js - Jalali date utilities

## Code Style
- Use Svelte 5 syntax
- Prefer functional components
- Extract complex logic to lib/
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use meaningful variable names

## Testing
- Test Jalali date conversions carefully
- Verify drag & drop on each change
- Check responsive behavior
- Test with real data IDs (see claude.md)

## Never
- Don't use Gregorian-only date logic
- Don't block user actions (only warn)
- Don't ignore accessibility
